### AnyUnit
Write Once, Test Everywhere

[.Net Standard][netstd] and [Portable Class Libraries][pcl] allow you to code to a single dll that can run on multiple .net or .net like platforms.

**Problem**, if you want to test for these platforms you have to use a testing framework specific for each platform and compile your unit tests specifically for each platform.

**Solution**, The goal of AnyUnit is to target the broadest .net standard and PCL profiles possible and implement both describing tests and executing tests in the profile. To have runner executables specific for each platform which can consolidate results in a clear and consistent way.

See [Pcl Unit Design and Philosophy][Design].

#### Layout
 - **Contrib**: Basic Extensions on Assertion and Test Discovery ported from other Frameworks
 - **AnyUnit**: Core Assertion, Discovery and Runner library
 - **Runner**: Aggregating runner and platform specfic runners
 - **WhoTestsTheTesters**: Code to test Tests

#### Status 
Windows: [![Build Status][WinImg]][WinLink] Mono: [![Build Status][MonoImg]][MonoLink]
